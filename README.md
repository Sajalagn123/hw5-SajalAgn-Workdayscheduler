## Description
I wrote out all the steps I need to take to get started on this assignment.

I added the containers for the timeblocks in the html file that make up the skeleton of the the main content being displayed.

I added more time block rows that go on all the way until 17:00 or 5pm. I also had it coded so that the page dynamically color codes when an hour is in the past, present, or future. The past is light grey, the present is red, and the future is colored green.

## Instalation
To install my project, I created a repository for it on Github. After that I cloned the repository onto my desktop. I then copied the folders from my class repository and pasted them into my folder. From there, I opened the assignments into a serperate folder.
