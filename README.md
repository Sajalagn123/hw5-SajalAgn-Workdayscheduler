## Description
I wrote out all the steps I need to take to get started on this assignment.

I added the containers for the timeblocks in the html file that make up the skeleton of the the main content being displayed.

I added more time block rows that go on all the way until 17:00 or 5pm. I also had it coded so that the page dynamically color codes when an hour is in the past, present, or future. The past is light grey, the present is red, and the future is colored green.

The page now displays the current date at the top of the page.

I changed the look of the buttons so they are more centered and changed the hours listed from military time to the am/pm format. Also the text entered is stored in local storage when save is clicked.

## Instalation
To install my project, I created a repository for it on Github. After that I cloned the repository onto my desktop. I then copied the folders from my class repository and pasted them into my folder. From there, I opened the assignments into a serperate folder.
